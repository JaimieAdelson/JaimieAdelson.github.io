    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a researcher at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, Washington where I estimate the burden of sensory and neurological disorders for the Global Burden of Disease Study. 
      
      I have a multidisciplinary background in public health and biomedical research.  My work has included a Fulbright Fellowship in Indonesia, a non-profit teaching and outreach position in Namibia,
      and positions in the U.S. non-profit and government sectors. My skills include research design, data analysis, grant and report
      writing, curriculum development, project supervision, and public speaking to diverse audiences.
